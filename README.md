# Squad Manager 🤖🚀
**The Ultimate Autonomous Development Agency for Gemini CLI**

> *"The age of prompt-engineering is over. The age of Squad-Directing has begun."*

**Squad Manager** is not a coding assistant. It is a **fully autonomous software development agency** living in your terminal. You are the Director. They are the Squad.

You give one high-level mission. They execute the entire engineering lifecycle—from architectural design to CI/CD release.

## 🤯 The Recursion Proof
**This tool built itself.** 
The code, the scripts, and this very README were architected, written, tested, and released by the Squad Manager itself, running in recursive mode.

## 🔥 Features that Ship

### 🎬 Director Mode: One Prompt -> Full App
Forget chatting back and forth. With **Director Mode**, you provide **one mission**, and the Squad takes over.

```bash
gemini "/squad build 'Create a snake game in Python using Pygame'"
```

The Director orchestrates the workflow:
1.  **🏗️ Architect:** Designs the system, chooses the stack (Python/Node/Go), and writes the `design_doc.md`.
2.  **🛡️ Sentinel:** Writes the **Test Suite** first (TDD) based on the design.
3.  **📦 DevOps:** Initializes the repo, `pyproject.toml`, and git branches.
4.  **🛠️ Grunt:** Implements the code to pass the tests. Runs the "Gauntlet" (Lint/TypeCheck).
5.  **👿 Gatekeeper:** Audits the PR for security and logic. Merges only if perfect.
6.  **🎮 UAT:** Verifies the installation and functionality like a human user.

### 👥 The Agent Roster
Your new team works 24/7. They don't need coffee. They don't complain about legacy code.

*   **Architect:** The visionary. Handles `design_doc.md` and ADRs.
*   **Grunt:** The builder. Polyglot coder (Python `uv`, Node `npm`, Go `mod`).
*   **Sentinel:** The protector. Enforces 100% test coverage.
*   **DevOps:** The release manager. Handles SemVer, Git Tags, and GitHub Releases.
*   **Gatekeeper:** The enforcer. Strict CI/CD auditor.
*   **UAT:** The user. Runs "Black Box" verification.

### 🌐 Polyglot Powerhouse
The Squad speaks your language.
*   **Python:** Uses `uv`, `ruff`, `mypy`.
*   **Node.js:** Uses `npm`, `eslint`, `vitest`.
*   **Go:** Uses `go mod`, `golangci-lint`.
