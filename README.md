# Squad Manager 🤖🚀
**The Ultimate Autonomous Development Team for Gemini CLI**

Stop babysitting your AI. Start directing a squad.

**Squad Manager** is not just another coding assistant. It's a **fully autonomous software development agency** living in your terminal. You give the order, and a specialized team of AI agents executes the entire engineering lifecycle—from architecture to release.

## 🔥 Features that Ship

### 🎬 Director Mode: One Prompt -> Full App
Forget chat-pong. With **Director Mode**, you provide **one high-level mission**, and the Squad takes over.

```bash
gemini "/squad build 'Create a snake game in Python'"
```

The Director orchestrates the entire workflow:
1.  **Architect** designs the system & chooses the stack.
2.  **Sentinel** writes the test suite *first* (TDD).
3.  **DevOps** initializes the repo & bumps versions.
4.  **Grunt** implements the code to pass the tests.
5.  **Gatekeeper** audits the PR & enforces quality.
6.  **UAT** verifies the installation & functionality.

### 👥 The Agent Roster
Your new team is ready to work 24/7. No coffee breaks. No complaints.

*   **🏗️ Architect:** The visionary. Decides the tech stack, file structure, and high-level design.
*   **🛠️ Grunt:** The builder. Writes the implementation code. Polyglot expert.
*   **🛡️ Sentinel:** The protector. Writes comprehensive test suites before a single line of code is written.
*   **📦 DevOps:** The release manager. Handles versioning, git tags, and release notes.
*   **👿 Gatekeeper:** The enforcer. Strict CI/CD auditor that prevents bad code from merging.
*   **🎮 UAT:** The user. Actually runs and verifies the application works as expected.

### 🌐 Polyglot Powerhouse
The Squad speaks your language. Whether it's **Python (uv)**, **Node.js (npm)**, or **Go (go mod)**, the agents adapt their tools and workflows automatically.

### 🚫 The End of Babysitting
Most AI coding tools require you to copy-paste code, fix imports, and debug errors. **Squad Manager** does the debugging for you. If a test fails, the Grunt fixes it. If the build breaks, DevOps repairs it. **You simply review the PR.**
